**Project Overview: **

This is my first code project, created for practice.

The goal of this script is to retrieve pull request information from a GitHub repository using Python. 

**Script Algorithm: **

1. Install and import the requests module. 
2. Make an API call using the requests.get command with the appropriate URL. 
3. The response, in JSON format, is automatically converted into a dictionary. 
4. Successfully extracted the output in two different formats.
     a) for multiple keys of a single user.
     b) single key value for multiple users.
